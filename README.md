# Parkour Movement Estimator

Done for my Master's summer project.

Very rough and just a proof of concept at the moment.

Plans:


- Have it work on more movements.
- Have it work on longer clips.
- Integrate it into a website.
- Look into a better keypoint analysis tool (if possible).

Moved to PyTorch.
Used to Tensorflow so the code is VERY janky.
Will need to neaten the code.
